# 🐾 PawConnect Nepal

**PawConnect Nepal** is a personal mission-driven project to help rescue dogs from Nepal find loving homes across the globe — while supporting local shelters through better visibility and easier donation flows.  
Built with love as a dog parent and product builder, this platform reflects my passion for solving meaningful problems at the intersection of technology, design, operations, and social impact.

## 💻 What I Built and Managed

- Ran local and international user surveys to uncover adoption and donation friction points  
- Defined key user journeys and product goals from research insights  
- Designed a responsive, mobile-first UX using Framer (no-code)  
- Created a dog–adopter matching interface with contact pathways  
- Integrated donation flows (eSewa + Khalti) with transparency in mind  
- Developed onboarding workflows to support individual shelter pages  
- Built modular UI to scale dogs and shelters easily across the platform

## 🌱 Current Status

I'm actively reaching out to local shelters and onboarding them.  
This is an evolving platform — the long-term goal is to sustainably expand the reach, bring more shelters online, and help more dogs find their forever homes.
