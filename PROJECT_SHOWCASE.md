# 🐾 PawConnect Nepal
PawConnect Nepal is a mission-driven web platform I built solo to help rescue dogs from Nepal find loving homes internationally and make it easier for shelters to receive donations.
This is a sustainable, long-term side project I continue to expand — with shelters being onboarded gradually.

## 🔍 Problem
Despite hundreds of amazing dogs being rescued across Nepal, shelters struggle with two main challenges:
Lack of visibility: Most dogs remain unseen beyond local areas.


Limited funding options: Donations are difficult due to lack of digital platforms and verified information.



## 🎯 Vision
Bridge the gap between adopters, shelters, and donors through a simple, mobile-first interface that makes:
Discovering adoptable dogs easier


Reaching out to shelters more accessible


Donating to Nepali shelters more transparent



## 👣 Process Overview
1. Research & Discovery
Created a bilingual survey shared across Nepali and global dog lover communities


Collected insights on adoption preferences, international concerns, and donation trust factors


Defined two core user groups: Potential Adopters and Animal Welfare Supporters


2. Product Planning
Mapped user journeys based on survey insights


Identified friction points: trust, visibility, and ease of action


Prioritized MVP features that deliver immediate value while remaining scalable


3. Design & Prototyping
Designed low-fidelity wireframes in Framer's Wireframer


Iterated through visual layouts for mobile-first experience


Chose a minimalist layout to keep focus on dogs and shelters


Created flexible components for dog cards, shelter pages, and donation sections


4. Build (No-Code)
Built responsive pages using Framer (desktop, tablet, mobile)


Designed reusable stacks for scalability


Manually uploaded sample data for shelters and dogs


Ensured WCAG-friendly contrast, font sizes, and layouts


5. Donation Integration
Designed side-by-side QR and detail layouts for eSewa and Khalti (local payment gateways)


Added editable stack structure for future shelters’ details


Used clear visual hierarchy to aid user trust


6. Matching Interface
Displayed adoptable dogs by shelter


Tag-based dog personality and health indicators for fast user scanning


Provided shelter contact information without involvement in the process


7. Shelter Onboarding & Outreach
Created outreach message/email to connect with shelters via social media or email


Built dedicated individual pages for shelters with donation and contact info


Ensured the site allows gradual addition of shelters without redesign
